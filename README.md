# awesome-LLM-Driven-Collective-Intelligence
Collective intelligence (CI) has emerged as a cornerstone for advancing toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with Large Language Models (LLMs) now serving as the primary driver. In this study, we present the first systematic framework to characterize the evolutionary trajectory of CI, and conduct a review of the role of LLMs in driving CI.
